## Turning Data into Decisions 🎯  

Hey there! I'm a Data Analyst with 1.5+ years of experience driven by curiosity and on a mission to leverage data to understand the "why" behind the "what". Whether it's wrangling data or visualizing trends in dashboards, I love turning raw numbers into powerful and meaningful stories.
